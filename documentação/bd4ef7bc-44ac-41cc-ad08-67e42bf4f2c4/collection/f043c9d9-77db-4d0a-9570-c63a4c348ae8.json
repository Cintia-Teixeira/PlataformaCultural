Please note the request might result multiple sub-traces. Large jumps in the timestamps (> 60s) or improbable transitions lead to trace splits if a complete matching could not be found. The algorithm might not be able to match all points. Outliers are removed if they can not be matched successfully.","event":[{"listen":"prerequest","script":{"id":"bb5c84a8-8bdd-4ef6-a726-c1f2f2e04266","type":"text/javascript","exec":[""]}},{"listen":"test","script":{"id":"e2a1dc9c-db50-4978-b121-adccd300d9b0","type":"text/javascript","exec":[""]}}],"_postman_isSubFolder":true},{"name":"Matrix API","item":[{"name":"Genral usage","event":[{"listen":"prerequest","script":{"id":"01019932-e944-40ef-a3e6-e1bf40e5a4f8","exec":[""],"type":"text/javascript"}}],"_postman_id":"520d3f1a-5762-4c78-90a8-b18471803344","protocolProfileBehavior":{"disableBodyPruning":true},"request":{"method":"GET","header":[],"url":{"raw":"{{LocationIQ_Endpoint_URL}}/v1/:service/:profile/:coordinates?key={{Your_API_Key}}","host":["{{LocationIQ_Endpoint_URL}}"],"path":["v1",":service",":profile",":coordinates"],"query":[{"key":"key","value":"{{Your_API_Key}}"},{"key":"bearings","value":"10,20;40,30;30,9","description":"Limits the search to segments with given bearing in degrees towards true north in clockwise direction.\nList of positive integer pairs separated by semi-colon and bearings array should be equal to length of coordinate array.\n\nInput Value :- {bearing};{bearing}[;{bearing} ...]\nBearing follows the following format :\nbearing\t{value},{range} integer 0 .. 360,integer 0 .. 180","disabled":true},{"key":"radiuses","value":"500;200;300","description":"Limits the search to given radius in meters\nRadiuses array length should be same as coordinates array, eaach value separated by semi-colon.\nInput Value - {radius};{radius}[;{radius} ...]\nRadius has following format :-\ndouble >= 0 or unlimited (default)","disabled":true},{"key":"generate_hints","value":"false","description":"Adds a Hint to the response which can be used in subsequent requests, see hints parameter.\nInput Value - true (default), false\nFormat - Base64 String","disabled":true},{"key":"approaches","value":"curb;curb;curb","description":"Keep waypoints on curb side.\nInput Value - {approach};{approach}[;{approach} ...]\nFormat - curb or unrestricted (default)","disabled":true},{"key":"exclude","value":"toll","description":"Additive list of classes to avoid, order does not matter.\ninput Value - {class}[,{class}]\nFormat - A class name determined by the profile or none.","disabled":true},{"key":"sources","value":"0","description":"Use location with given index as source.\n [ {index};{index}[;{index} ...] or all (default) ]\n=> index\t 0 <= integer < #locations","disabled":true},{"key":"destinations","value":"2","description":"Use location with given index as destination.\n[ {index};{index}[;{index} ...] or all (default) ]","disabled":true},{"key":"annotations","value":"distance","description":"Returns additional metadata for each coordinate along the route geometry. \n[ true, false (default), nodes, distance, duration ]","disabled":true},{"key":"fallback_speed","value":"25.65","description":"If no route found between a source/destination pair, calculate the as-the-crow-flies distance, then use this speed to estimate duration.\ndouble > 0","disabled":true},{"key":"fallback_coordinate","value":"input","description":"When using a fallback_speed, use the user-supplied coordinate (input), or the snapped location (snapped) for calculating distances.\n[ input (default), or snapped ]","disabled":true}],"variable":[{"id":"57440fb5-4b23-42df-b068-06d54c91058f","key":"service","value":"matrix","type":"string"},{"id":"8c2b836a-c8a5-4f45-972b-6aa0ae7bc68c","key":"profile","value":"driving","type":"string"},{"id":"66d6a032-f1b3-40b5-99fc-e7be23a500e6","key":"coordinates","value":"-0.16102,51.523854;-0.15797,51.52326;-0.161593,51.522550","type":"string"}]},"description":"Computes duration of the fastest route between all pairs of supplied coordinates.
